- Set the list of default BLAST output fields as suggested by @eparejatobes
- Fixed Any[Blast]OutputField new name
- Added totalReadsNumber output in the split loquat; and pass it as an input to the countint loquat
- Added frequency table to the counting loquat
- Renamed totalReadsNumber to mergedReadsNumber
- Added BLAST no-hits output
- Added merging for the no-hits chunks
- Added flash not-merged outputs
- Added a lot of crap to the MG7Parameters to make blast command configurable
- Added blastn as a default command
- Fixed blast for the case when the output is empty (create the empty output file)
- Fixed merge datamappings
- Removed merged reads count from the split step
- Added outputs with LCA/BBH-not-assigned read IDs
- Writing the whole no-hits read instead of just its header #44
- Changed some data names; added .fa extension to the no-hits output
- Added a loquat that counts stats per each sample #9, #20
- Added a loquat that merges sample-stats into a summary table #9, #20
- Added a refined CSVFormat with \n line-ending and a shortcut for CSVWriter instantiation #48
- Fixed also the CSVReader format
- Updated the loquat dep version #39
- Moved some CSV-related things from the package object
- Some more advanced CSV trickery
- Added neccessary fields as implicits; it allows to make csv-select typesafe
- Migrated assignment code to the typesafe CSV-utils
- Made blast-filter predicate configurable; added default
- Updated to blast-api 0.7.0
- Set blastn defaults to what was discussed with @eparejatobes and @rtobes #51
- * Moved defaultBlastOutRec out of the package object
- Set up dependency on rnacentraldb; updated fastarious
- Using BlastDBRelease[AnyBlastDB] instead of the old AnyReferenceDB; removed old reference-db code (including GIs stuff)
- Removed bundles package; rearrenged related code
- Updated to rnacentral-0.2.1
- Fixed two bugs causing this mysterious null problem: + the `implicitly` val for the `argValsToSeq` in the abstract `AnyMG7Parameters` trait. Even though the type for this `implicitly[...]` was fixed, it turned out to be `null` + the default predicate in the abstract trait had to be a lazy val (or a def) #53
- Fixed assignment data-mapping (it doesn't need no-hits results)
- Removed not-assigned outputs, because they are always empty
- Fixed stats data mappings inputs
- Fixed input reads archive handling; it has to be uncompressed first
- Creating output file before trying to write to it
- Fixed summary step input
- Fixed the order of stats headers/values (Map mixes up the order) #55
- Fixed FASTQ parsing in the stats step #55
- Fixed the summary tasks and table #55
- Interchanged assign and merge steps, so that assign is done in parallel per chunk #56
- Removed unnecessary dependency overrides, commented out fat-jar settings
- Various fixes in the LCA algorithm and assignment data-mappings #47
- Changed default Blast filter to (qcovs == 100 && gaps == 0); made gaps a mandatory field #57
- Keep only the top BLAST hits #58
- clean test sources
- rename src folders to match the package name
