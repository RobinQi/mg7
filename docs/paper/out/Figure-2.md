#### Figure 2: Lowest Common Ancestor algorithm for taxonomic assignment.

The Left panel displays an example of the application of LCA algorithm in a *sensu stricto* mode. A, B, C and D represent taxonomy tree nodes with assigned reads. Right panel displays the *in line* mode of assignment which is an exception for the *sensu stricto* mode of application of LCA algorithm. The *in line* mode is used when all the nodes are located in a line without bifurcations. In that case the taxon assigned is the most specific (the most distant from the root).
